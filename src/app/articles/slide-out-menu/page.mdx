## Introduction

Slide-out menus, also known as drawers, are a staple of modern user interfaces. They provide an elegant way to present additional content or actions without overwhelming the main screen. In this article, weâ€™ll explore the creation of a **custom slide-out drawer component** in React, focusing on **accessibility, animations, and ease of use**.

This custom drawer offers features like **focus trapping, scroll locking, keyboard accessibility**, and smooth **spring-based animations** using popular libraries like **Framer Motion** and **react-focus-lock**.

## Features

### 1. Smooth Animations with Framer Motion

The drawer uses **Framer Motion** for its open and close animations. The spring-based transitions provide a polished and fluid experience for users:

- **Initial Position**: The drawer slides in from the right (x: "100%").
- **Open Position**: Animates smoothly to x: 0.
- **Close Animation**: Slides back to x: "100%" when dismissed.

### 2. Focus Management

Accessibility is a key consideration. Using react-focus-lock, the drawer traps focus within its content when open, ensuring that:

- Keyboard navigation stays confined to the drawer.
- Focus returns to the previously focused element when the drawer is closed.

### 3. Scroll Locking

To prevent background scrolling when the drawer is open, the component integrates **react-remove-scroll**. This ensures:

- The content behind the drawer remains fixed.
- The user experience feels more intuitive and controlled.

### 4. Escape Key Support

Keyboard users can close the drawer by pressing the Escape key, thanks to a custom useEscapeKey hook. This feature enhances usability and adheres to accessibility best practices.

### 5. Overlay Click-to-Close

An overlay behind the drawer provides an easy way for users to dismiss it. Clicking anywhere on the overlay triggers the onOpenChange callback, closing the drawer.

## Code Overview

Hereâ€™s a high-level look at the Drawer component:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import styles from "./Drawer.module.css";
import FocusLock from "react-focus-lock";
import { RemoveScroll } from "react-remove-scroll";
import { useEscapeKey } from "../../hooks/useEscapeKey";
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from "framer-motion";

function Drawer({
  children,
  onOpenChange,
  isOpen,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  isOpen: boolean;
  onOpenChange: (isOpen: boolean) => void;
}) {
  useEscapeKey(() => {
    onOpenChange(false);
  });

  return (
    <>
      {isOpen && (
        <div
          className={styles.overlay}
          onClick={() => {
            onOpenChange(false);
          }}
        ></div>
      )}
      <RemoveScroll enabled={isOpen} forwardProps>
        <AnimatePresence>
          {isOpen ? (
            <div className={styles.drawerContainer}>
              <FocusLock returnFocus>
                <motion.div
                  className={styles.drawer}
                  initial={{ x: "100%" }}
                  animate={{ x: 0 }}
                  transition={{
                    duration: 0.2,
                    type: "spring",
                    stiffness: 200,
                    damping: 25,
                  }}
                  exit={{ x: "100%" }}
                >
                  <div>{children}</div>
                  <button
                    onClick={() => {
                      onOpenChange(false);
                    }}
                  >
                    Close
                  </button>
                </motion.div>
              </FocusLock>
            </div>
          ) : null}
        </AnimatePresence>
      </RemoveScroll>
    </>
  );
}

export default Drawer;
```

## How It Works

### 1. Opening and Closing

The drawerâ€™s visibility is controlled by the `isOpen` prop, with `onOpenChange` toggling the state. Clicking the overlay or the close button sets `isOpen` to `false`.

### 2. Focus Management

Using `react-focus-lock`, all focusable elements outside the drawer are locked, ensuring that the user cannot accidentally navigate away.

### 3. Animation Logic

Framer Motion powers the animations:

- When the drawer opens, it animates from x: "100%" to x: 0.
- On close, it slides back to x: "100%".

### 4. Scroll Locking

`react-remove-scroll` ensures that the background content does not scroll when the drawer is open, enhancing the user experience.

### 5. Escape Key Support

The useEscapeKey hook listens for the Escape key and triggers the close logic.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the Drawer component in your application:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import Drawer from './components/Drawer'

function App() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Open Drawer</button>
      <Drawer isOpen={isOpen} onOpenChange={setIsOpen}>
        <div>
          <h2>Slide-Out Menu</h2>
          <p>Hereâ€™s some content inside the drawer!</p>
        </div>
      </Drawer>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Accessibility Features

### 1. Focus Trapping

Users navigating with a keyboard will have their focus locked within the drawer when itâ€™s open. This ensures a smooth and accessible experience.

### 2. Dismiss with Escape Key

Pressing the **Escape** key provides a quick way to dismiss the drawer, enhancing usability for power users.

### 3. ARIA Roles and Labels

You can extend the component to include ARIA attributes like role="dialog" and aria-labelledby for better screen reader support.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Managing Focus and Scroll Locking

**Solution**: By integrating react-focus-lock and react-remove-scroll, the component ensures a seamless experience for both keyboard and mouse users.

### Challenge: Smooth Animations

**Solution**: Framer Motionâ€™s spring transition provides natural and fluid animations.
