<h3 className="mb-10 text-3xl">Challenge</h3>

Leeto, a platform designed to help HR teams manage employee benefits and facilitate reimbursement requests, grew rapidly in usage, serving over 30,000 monthly active users. As the platform evolved, its performance became a critical issue due to technical debt and early architectural decisions. These challenges led to slow loading times, inefficient runtime interactions, and an overall suboptimal user experience.

The performance issues not only frustrated users but also risked impacting user retention and satisfaction, particularly for a product competing in the enterprise SaaS space, where smooth and responsive interactions are key expectations.

The need for a scalable, maintainable, and efficient email system was clear. The goal was to deliver a robust solution that enhanced email quality, improved developer efficiency, and met user expectations.

<h3 className="mb-10 text-3xl">Solution</h3>

To gain leadership support, we demonstrated the business value of under-the-hood improvements and aligned with stakeholders to allocate time for this initiative. The collaborative action plan included both short-term wins and long-term performance improvements.

Key optimizations I contributed to included:

- **Switching Build Tools:** Migrated from Webpack to Vite, reducing bundle size and leveraging Viteâ€™s efficient production builds.
- **Edge Optimization:** Partnered with the backend/infra team to integrate Cloudflare and enable optimization toggles for improved caching and content delivery.
- **Perceived Performance Enhancements:** Used skeleton loaders, suspense patterns, blurhash images, and TanStack Query to minimize layout shifts and improve the visual feedback loop.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Implemented list virtualization with infinite scroll and pagination to optimize pages displaying large datasets.

To maintain long-term performance:

- Updated front-end team guidelines to include React performance best practices, such as memoization and caching unstable references.
- Introduced a performance-focused code review checklist to ensure adherence to these standards.
- Set up a CI performance budget check to notify the team if pull requests breached defined performance thresholds.
- Conducted biannual dependency reviews to remove unnecessary libraries and streamline bundle size.

<h3 className="mb-10 text-3xl">Results</h3>

The performance optimization initiative delivered substantial improvements:

- Increased Lighthouse scores across key metrics, showcasing enhanced loading and runtime performance.
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders, improving responsiveness for critical interactions.
- Enhanced perceived performance through visual feedback elements, reducing user frustration during loading periods.
- Boosted user satisfaction and retention, aligning the product experience with the expectations of enterprise clients.

The success of this initiative demonstrated how collaborative efforts and strategic prioritization could resolve deep-seated performance challenges, driving tangible improvements in both user experience and business outcomes.
