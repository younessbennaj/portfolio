<h3 className="mb-10 text-3xl">Challenge</h3>

Transactional emails are a vital part of any SaaS product, shaping user perceptions and ensuring smooth communication. At Leeto, the email system was a persistent source of inefficiency and frustration:

- **Developer Burden:** The email stack was managed in the back-end codebase using Ruby and static HTML templates. Back-end developers, lacking the expertise in email design, faced significant challenges in building pixel-perfect, cross-client-compatible emails. The reliance on <table />-based layouts for email compatibility further complicated their workflow.
- **Quality Issues:** Clients frequently complained about broken assets, inconsistent formatting, and poor overall quality, damaging user trust.
- **Scalability Concerns:** With the growing number of features and clients, maintaining and updating email templates became increasingly complex and time-consuming.
- **Designer Frustration:** The design team’s vision often went unmet due to the technical limitations of the workflow, creating misalignment between design and execution.

The need for a scalable, maintainable, and efficient email system was clear. The goal was to deliver a robust solution that enhanced email quality, improved developer efficiency, and met user expectations.

<h3 className="mb-10 text-3xl">Solution</h3>

To address these challenges, I led the transition to a modern, modular, and scalable email stack:

1. **Research and Tool Selection:**

   - Benchmarked existing email development tools and frameworks.
   - Selected [Maizzle](https://maizzle.com/) for its TailwindCSS integration and modular design, enabling rapid development and reuse of components.

2. **Dedicated Email Stack:**

   - Decoupled the email stack from the back-end and created a dedicated repository for email templates.
   - Introduced Postmark as the intermediary for template management and email delivery.

3. **Optimized Asset Management:**

   - Collaborated with the back-end and infrastructure teams to integrate AWS for secure and reliable asset storage.

4. **Custom CI/CD Pipeline:**

   - Designed and implemented a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing, staging, and deployment of email templates. This ensured smooth updates and seamless integration with the back-end.

5. **Streamlined Workflow:**
   - Inventoried existing templates and created detailed documentation for better traceability.
   - Worked closely with designers to align template implementation with design specifications, ensuring pixel-perfect results.

<h3 className="mb-10 text-3xl">Results</h3>

The revamped email system delivered impactful results across key areas:

- **Improved Quality:** Emails became pixel-perfect, fully functional, and compatible with major email clients like Gmail and Outlook, significantly enhancing the user experience.
- **Developer Efficiency:** By removing the back-end dependency and introducing modular components, developers could build and update templates faster, freeing time for other critical tasks.
- **Scalability and Maintainability:** The modular system allowed for rapid creation of new templates and seamless updates during major initiatives like Leeto’s rebranding.
- **Streamlined Deployment:** The CI/CD pipeline automated QA and deployment processes, reducing errors and ensuring smooth production rollouts.
- **Higher User Satisfaction:** Clients reported a dramatic improvement in email quality, with assets loading correctly and designs meeting expectations.

This project not only addressed immediate challenges but also future-proofed Leeto’s email system, enabling the team to scale efficiently as the platform grew.
